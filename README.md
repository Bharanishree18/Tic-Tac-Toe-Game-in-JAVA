Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Game! ðŸŽ® This is a simple, interactive console-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, where a human player competes against a computer opponent.

## Features

- **Play as Player 'X'**: Enter your move by selecting a number from the grid (1-9).
- **Computer AI 'O'**: The computer employs smart strategies, including blocking moves and a tricky move to take the center.
- **Dynamic Win/Tie Detection**: The game ends when a player wins or the board is full.
- **Simple Console-Based UI**: Easy-to-follow interface in the terminal.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-game.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd tic-tac-toe-game
    ```
3. Compile the Java code:
    ```bash
    javac TicTacToe.java
    ```
4. Run the game:
    ```bash
    java TicTacToe
    ```

## How to Play

- The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid with numbers (1-9) corresponding to the positions.
- Player 'X' starts by entering a number (1-9) to mark their move.
- The computer, playing as 'O', will respond with its move.
- The game ends when:
  - A player aligns three marks (rows, columns, or diagonals).
  - The board is full, resulting in a tie.

## Example Gameplay


## Key Code Features

- **AI Logic**:
  - The computer prioritizes winning moves.
  - If no winning move exists, it blocks the player.
  - A tricky strategy ensures competitive play.
- **Win/Tie Detection**: The program checks for winning conditions (rows, columns, diagonals) and ties after each move.
- **Dynamic Board Display**: The game board updates in real-time after every move.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.
- Allow two-player mode for human vs. human gameplay.
- Introduce difficulty levels for computer AI.
